Linear Regression with One VariableThis project implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict the profits of a restaurant franchise's food trucks based on the population of various cities.Project OverviewImagine you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The goal is to use existing data from cities where you already have trucks to predict potential profits in new locations.DatasetThe dataset ex1data1.txt contains two columns:Column 1: Population of a city (in 10,000s).Column 2: Profit of a food truck in that city (in $10,000s). A negative value indicates a loss.Implementation DetailsThe notebook covers the following machine learning steps:Data Visualization: Using matplotlib to plot the population vs. profit to identify patterns.Data Preprocessing: Adding an intercept term to the data and initializing parameters (theta) and the learning rate (alpha).Cost Function: Computing the cost $J(\theta)$ to monitor the convergence of the model.Gradient Descent: Implementing the gradient descent algorithm to minimize the cost function and find the optimal parameters.DependenciesTo run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:numpypandasmatplotlibHow to UseClone the repository.Ensure ex1data1.txt is in the same directory as the notebook.Run the Linear_Regression.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment to train the model and see the prediction results.
